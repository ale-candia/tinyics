- Scada should work with simulation time not amount of packets being sent.

- Obligatory Naming of PLCs and HMIs.

- Log Address by name when calling BuildNetwork.

- Rename SCADA to HMI?

- Why is there two acknowledgements in our case but our reference real life data acknowledges the packet and sends the data within that acknowledgement?

- Improve reading coils, currently only the plc_in.digitalPorts are being sent.

- Update rate of process should be defined by the process being simulated. Since faster changing process may need smaller update time.
