### CURRENTLY WORKING ON ###

- Implement PLC and Industrial Process loops from python

- try out different simulation scenarios and leave them as separate examples

- Add Industrial-Process abstract class to the python bindings. (this has a special trick, see: https://medium.com/practical-coding/three-advanced-pybind11-features-for-wrapping-c-code-into-python-6dbcac169b93)

- Make address vector in scada efficient for find and inserts

- Review, m_interval both for SCADA and PLC

- PENDING RESPONSE FUNCTIONALITY

- Try out many to many relationships (2 or more SCADAS vs 2 or more PLCs)

### LOWER PRIORITY ###

- Expose operators for custom Var class for easier usage (take into consideration the VarType)

- Add namespace modbus

- Find a way of setting a global simulation time, i.e. a time at which all simulations end.

- Rename SCADA to HMI?

- Update rate of process should be defined by the process being simulated. Since faster changing process may need smaller update time.

- What if we need to send information of a single request/response in multiple packets?

- More Documentation.

- (??) Join PLC_in and PLC_out into a single data structure (using Coils, Input Registers and Digital Inputs) to work better with the modbus protocol

- What happens a certain amount of data in the packet is not sended, can this happen?

- Timeout for read packet (can timeouts happen??)
